The illusions of Competence refer to a collection of illusions that make us **think we are learning something efficiently when we are actually not learning it at all**", but just going through information that will be quickly forgotten.

There are multiple activities that can lead to this kind of Illusion:

1.  **Rereading:** just passively rereading information multiple times without trying to recall it in some way (questions, simple concept retrieval, etc.) after rereading, make us feel that we already know all of the information when we actually know nothing of it. This is because when rereading all the information is right there and is easy to understand it, it's already processed for us. But this is just shallow understanding that will be quickly dusted off from our brain if we don't actively try to recall it.
2.  **Highlighting:** text highlighting can also make us think that we have placed the concept in our brains, as we are actively doing something (highlighting text with our hand) when we actually didn't at all. We should always try to highlight as less text as possible, ideally only one or two sentences per paragraph, just the main ideas.
3.  **False understanding:** when we read or listen to someone talking about a certain topic that we are understanding, we may tend to think that we have already understood the concept, but this is just an illusion as we actually need to practice ourselves, make our own solution to the problem to have at least some chance of understanding it. Same happens when we check the solution to a problem before trying to solve it ourselves; we tend to have this (false) thought of "Ok, it's obvious why they solve the problem this way, definitely I understand this!" but unfortunately it won't stick much into our brains if we don't go hands-on.

# Counter by:

-   **Studying with others**: explaining your reasoning to others can help you more easily catch where your thinking has gone astray. Explaining concepts (as you understand them) can help you spot the gaps in your knowledge.
    
-   **Double-checking**: wherever possible, you should shift your attention (to a different task or problem) and then come back to double-check your answers.
    
-   **Practice tests**: this forces you to confront what you really know and what you don’t. If you can’t recall the material or solve a problem
