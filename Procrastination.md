# What is procrastination?

-   When you think about something that you don’t really want to do (it’s boring, it’s difficult, it’s time-consuming), it activates the brain’s pain centres. Naturally enough, the brain tries to avoid the pain but turning your attention to something else – ANYTHING else – to make you feel better.
-   Procrastination shares some similarities with addictions – the action provides instant gratification, but is detrimental in the long run.
-   If you can get started despite the initial discomfort, the pain will dissipate.

# What causes procrastination?

It’s not just boredom…

-   (Perceived) low chance of success = “ugh, I can’t do it right anyway, why even bother?”
-   (Perceived) low value of work = “this is stupid, what’s the point of doing this?”
-   High level of impulsiveness = “ooh, look, shiny!”

Emotions (e.g. fear, boredom) and interruptions are key cues for the brain to procrastinate.
