There’s a difference between:

-   **‘Active Procrastination’**, where you make a _deliberate_ decision to leave something until xxx time because you work better under pressure, and
-   **‘Passive Procrastination’**, where you are paralysed by indecision or fear and can’t complete work on time

If you are someone who finds they need a deadline to get motivated, create deadlines for yourself (e.g. “by xxx date, I will have read through these chapters”) at regular intervals. This essentially forces you to space out your learning sensibly, rather than panic and try and cram everything in at the last second.
