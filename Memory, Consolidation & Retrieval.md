**Memories are not fixed but living, breathing parts of your brain that are changing all of the time.**

# Working Memory

-   Like a leaky bucket - holds stuff for a bit, then loses it.
-   Can only hold about _four_ items in working memory.
-   As you master a technique, your brain 'chunks' items together into one concept - so you remember one item rather than four. This frees up space to think about other things.

# Long-term Memory

-   Like a warehouse - holds a lot of stuff, takes a bit of effort to find what you're looking for.

# Consolidation

-   The process by which information is moved from working memory to long-term memory.
-   Usually occurs during sleep - every time you sleep, memory structures are essentially broken down and re-built. The more often this happens, the stronger the memory is.
-   Practise and repetition strengthens the neural structures we're building as we're learning something new. It's particularly important for _abstract_ concepts.

# Retrieval & Reconsolidation

-   Whenever you recall a memory, it changes. This is because when you recall it, it's in a different context to when it was made, and this new context is incorporated.

# 'Knowledge Collapse'

-   Sometimes you 'hit a wall' in your understanding - things that made sense before can suddenly seem confusing.
-   This is caused by your brain restructuring or rearranging its understanding of a concept - it knocks down your old tower of understanding and builds new foundations for a better understanding of a concept.
-   Remember this is completely normal; it's frustrating, but it will pass.

# Visual-Spatial Memory

-   Humans are better at remembering the things we've seen and the places we've been rather than abstract concepts.
-   This is a product of millennia of evolution - remembering what a tiger looks like and how to find your way home is necessary for survival.
-   For the same reasons we are also likely to remember unusual facts/images (something out of the ordinary could be dangerous) and stories (experiences are easier to remember than facts).
