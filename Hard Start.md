These are a set of related methods that centre on the idea that doing the most difficult, boring, or urgent task(s) first is a more effective way to build momentum in your study sessions.

# Hard Start -> Jump to Easy

-   Look at the hard stuff first, even if you can’t understand it/solve it then and there.
-   Switch to easier stuff, then come back to the harder material/questions.
-   This technique allows your brain to subconsciously reflect on harder challenges while you’re working on other, more straightforward problems.

# Eat Your Frogs

-   Tackle the most important/complicated/hated task (‘the frog’) before any other task.
-   This technique allows you to get the tasks you _need_ to do – but don’t want to and are avoiding – completed and feel a sense of accomplishment early on in the day.
-   This is a good technique to clear tasks you’ve been procrastinating on.

# Most Important Task (MIT)

-   Focus on the most critical task that will create the most significant results.
-   Create a list of two or three MITs and focus on getting them done as soon as possible – keep this list separate from your general to-do list.
-   This technique allows you to complete the tasks that will have the most impact on your studies (or general life) rather than being distracted by and spending time on less important tasks.
