Michelangelo is known for becoming so engrossed in his paintings that he even forgets to eat or sleep. If you have had an experience where hours felt like minutes while wrapped up in a certain task, you have already experienced a flow state! The concept has appeared in many ancient philosophies, and modern research has confirmed that this experience is effectively real.

In order to achieve the flow state, according to some authors, **is important that a good balance between the perceived challenge of the task and the individual's own perceived skills exists**. So, either if the task is extremely challenging or extremely easy for the individual's skills it will be difficult to achieve this state of mind.
