# Willpower is a finite resource

-   ‘Willpower’ is the ability to delay gratification, resisting short-term temptations to meet long-term goals.
-   However, even if you are very good at this, you can’t do this all the time – it quite literally takes up energy (depletes glucose levels in the brain).

# Habit is an energy saver

-   By ‘running on autopilot’ the brain saves energy to focus on other things. An example might be walking: when you first started this as a child it took a lot of concentration, but now you can walk across a room without thinking about it.
-   Building good habits can allow us to achieve our long-term goals without excessive short-term effort.

# Habit Formation

-   In the beginning, you will need to perform the new habit often and consciously – you’ll need to practise regularly and concentrate on what you’re doing. _Habits generally take between 30 and 60 days to form; you’ll need to dedicate time every day to the habit_

There four main stages to habit formation:

-   **Cue:** action or circumstance that _triggers_ the habit – e.g. a phone call -> trigger to stop working and talk; seeing a box of doughnuts -> trigger to eat one.
-   **Routine:** action _following_ the cue. This is stage that our brains go into ‘zombie’ mode and we act automatically – e.g. notification sound -> automatically look at your phone.
-   **Reward:** what we get after following the routine – e.g. smoke a cigarette -> hit of dopamine (caused by nicotine).
-   **Belief:** on some level, we believe in the habit or what the habit says about us as a person. Changing the underlying belief can help us change a bad habit or form a new one – e.g. ‘I’m a lazy person’ -> ‘I’m someone who exercises’.
