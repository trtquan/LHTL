# Apply willpower strategically

-   You can’t use willpower all the time (finite resource), but you can apply it to key points.
-   Habit formation is difficult to start with, so using willpower to ‘push through’ this difficult stage is a good use of energy.

# Habit Change

-   If we’re trying to _avoid triggering_ bad habits, we can try removing the cue. For example, if your bad habit is checking your phone every time you get a notification, you can turn off your phone.
-   If we’re trying to _change_ our bad habits into good ones, we want to target the routine – we want to switch out the ‘bad’ routine for a ‘good’ routine, so when we face the same cue, we perform a helpful action instead. For example, if your bad habit is eating a cookie (routine) every time you get bored (cue), you can change the routine to: bored -> go for a quick walk.
-   If we’re trying to _create_ a new, good, habit, cue and routine are important but we also need to make sure a good reward is in place – we want to encourage our brains to continue the good habit rather than give it up.
-   Changing an underlying belief can also help us change a bad habit or form a new one – e.g. ‘I’m a lazy person’ -> ‘I’m someone who exercises’.
