-   Writing out tasks you have to do later (today, tomorrow, this week, etc.) frees up your working memory to focus on what you have to concentrate on right now.
-   Making a list in the evening, before you go to bed, leads your brain to work out how to accomplish each task you need to do, or problem you need to solve, while you sleep. It can also stop thoughts about your to-do list buzzing round your mind when you're trying to doze off!
