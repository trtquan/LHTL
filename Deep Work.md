Deep Work vs Shallow Work

This is a concept that Cal Newport introduces in his best-selling book "[Deep Work](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/)". Deep Work consists of doing cognitively intensive work with an **extremely high level of concentration and focus, with zero distractions, just you and your brain single-tasking at the subject at hand**. According to Cal Newport doing Deep Work is one of the most valuable skills in our economy, as today **most people are constantly shallow workers, right the opposite of deep workers**, due to all the external stimulus, distractions, notifications and stuff that constantly bombard us all the time nowadays. Anyone that doesn't put some effort into managing and controlling his environment, will be controlled by it, without being able to deep work, and consequently being incapable of getting things done in an as effective and efficient way as possible.

Research has shown that **it takes approximately 25 minutes to go back to our full concentration state after a distraction** as illustrated in the attached graph _"Level of Connection vs Time"_, so that's why it's extremely important to remove any kind of distraction that may get us to lose our focus in order to get into deep work.

Finally, it's worth mentioning that **doing shallow work is not bad on its own**, as we all need to do this type of non-cognitive intensive work that provides little-to-no real value throughout our day (e.g.: checking and answering email, making phone calls, etc), but it's pretty much **recommended to schedule specific time-blocks to do this type of tasks**, and out of this time ranges we should be doing high-value deep work.

If we don't allocate specific times to do shallow work tasks we **fall into the trap of thinking we are doing relevant stuff when we are just extremely busy doing activities that won't add much value** (a kind of [[Illusion of Competence]], but more like an _Illusion of Productiveness_), and left-unmanaged, shallow-work can consume our entire day without even noticing it.
