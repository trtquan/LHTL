# Process Not Product

**Focusing on the ‘journey’ is better than focusing on the outcome**

-   When we focus on the outcome (‘product’) we pile on the pressure – by thinking that we _have to get this done_ we stress ourselves out.
-   **The product triggers the pain that causes us to procrastinate**
-   The ‘process’ is the small chunks of time that we need to carry out regularly to get the task done.
-   Example: if you need to write an article, rather than thinking: “I need to write this 2000-word article”, think “ok, let’s write for 20 minutes today, and another 20 minutes tomorrow.”
-   **Removing the specific outcome from our mind removes the friction associated with the task**
-   Focus on the process by breaking big tasks into small chunks, then allot 25-30-minute slots every day to work on each chunk.
-   Sometimes a chunk will take up a couple of slots, sometimes you’ll get a few chunks done in one slot; the important thing is to have REGULAR short slots to focus on one chunk.

**"By focusing on process rather than product, you allow yourself to back away from judging yourself, am I getting closer to finishing? And instead you allow yourself to relax into the flow of the work"**

# The Story You Tell Yourself Makes All The Difference

Mental tricks are invaluable in helping you reframe a situation to reduce anxiety and frustration.

-   **Label the feeling:** “I’m feeling upset right now because I failed the test.” – putting your feelings into a few brief words forces your brain to shift thinking from the emotional (not-always-logical) centres to the more rational parts; this automatically tones down your emotions and helps you see distortions in your thinking.
    
-   **Re-name the feeling:** “I’m scared” -> “I’m excited” – some emotions (such as fear and exhilaration) trigger the same biological responses (e.g. increased heart rate), re-naming the feeling from something negative to something positive that triggers similar reactions basically tricks your brain into seeing the bright side!
    
-   **Reframe Positively:** “Well I didn’t get X, so that leaves me free to pursue Y.” Turn weaknesses into strengths.
