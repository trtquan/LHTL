**Forming a new habit is hard, so you should aim to:**

-   Make everything involved in a task as easy and effortless as possible.
-   Make sure you are practicing the new habit.
-   Arrange your environment to make it less likely you will give up the new habit or lapse into a bad one.
-   'Tack on' (if possible) the new habit to an existing habit.

---

**Example - making things easy:**

-   You want to go for a run in the morning -> put your shoes and running gear in front of your bedroom door the night before.
-   You now can’t leave the room without seeing it (no forgetting to go for a run) and you’ve reduced the effort in getting ready (no ‘where did I put my shoes?’ ‘are my leggings in the laundry basket?’).

---

**Example - practicing:**

-   You've decided you will spend xxx time on your new habit every day.
-   You block out time to do this in your calendar/diary and set alerts on your phone so you don't forget.

---

**Example - arranging your environment:**

-   You want to quit smoking, so you stop going into the smoking areas and switch to online shopping so you're not tempted by the cigarettes at the shop counter.
-   You want to fit more exercise into your day, so you turn the junk room into a home gym.

---

**Example - 'tacking on' to an existing habit:**

-   You want to make sure you floss your teeth every day.
-   You already brush your teeth every day, so you make it your new habit to floss immediately after brushing.
