# Why 'Single-Task'?
![[Pasted image 20210218101756.png]]
**Single-tasking involves concentrating on ONE task at a time**

-   VERY IMPORTANT for focused thinking.
-   It is impossible to properly focus on more than one thing at a time - dividing your attention means you're only 'sort of' paying attention to both things.
-   Switching between tasks also takes a lot of brain power, so we want to keep this to a minimum.
-   It takes around 25 minutes to get back into a fully concentrated state after becoming distracted/switching to a different task.


So, this is a kind of [[Illusion of Competence]]

So, **if you are in Focus Mode, choose single-tasking, if you are in Diffuse Mode you could multitask to some extent**. Just make sure to multitask on things that require different cognitive areas of our brain. For example, you can watch TV or listening to music while doing exercise, check your social media while you chat with a relative, etc. but you cannot meditate while cooking or read a book while listening to a podcast.
