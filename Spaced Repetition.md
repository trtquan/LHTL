>_"We should let time for the mortar to dry"_ (i.e.: synaptic connections to form and strengthen)

The Spaced Repetition technique consists of **reviewing the material we are studying periodically over a few days, weeks or even months, but spaced in time.** This allows creating new neural structures that help moving information from working memory to long-term memory (refer to _[Working Memory and Long Term Memory](https://trello.com/c/cjXJwJon/7-working-memory-and-long-term-memory)_), and it's even more effective when combined with other techniques like [Active Recall](https://trello.com/c/prrrhRpX/33-active-recall).

Research has shown that **reviewing something N times in one day is much less prone for us to remember, in comparison to reviewing the same subject the same amount of times properly spaced across multiple days**. _"We should let time for the mortar to dry"_ (i.e.: synaptic connections to form and strengthen)

This repetition should be properly spaced: **frequently enough so to not forget completely of the learning subject, and spaced enough so to put the information retrieval process to exercise** a little bit (i.e.: not something that is already in working memory but somewhere in not-so-easy-retrievable (yet!) long-term memory), like in the attached picture. With each repetition, we increment a little bit the overall recall percentage over time until we reach high levels after several days of applying spaced repetition. The [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) software is great to put this procedure into practice!

In summary, instead of studying very intensively for a short period, **the best way to create strong neural connections is to practice regularly during an extended period**. If you study for an extended period you are not only using the focused mode, but also the diffuse mode when you change your attention to other subjects. Moreover, among other benefits, sleep between study sessions allows you to effectively fit new concepts.
