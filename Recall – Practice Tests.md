Tests are a good way of forcing your brain to retrieve the information. They also make it very obvious which topics you know and which you don’t.

# Solve problems rather than apply a technique

For example:

-   In a maths problem, look at what the question is asking (what are you trying to find out?)
-   Don’t simply apply a set equation (i.e. thinking, ‘Oh I would need to apply this equation to find this out’ is fine, but don’t actually use it at this stage)
-   Think about _how_ you would go about finding the answer ('well first I'd need to find out xxx, then I'd need to do yyy, then zzz')
-   Solve the problem without looking back at the textbook or your notes.
-   Once you can solve it by yourself without looking, then there’s no illusion of competence – clearly you can do it, because you just did it!

# Take tests BEFORE you read

-   Take mini tests before you read the book or watch the video – see if you can work out the answers before you ‘learn’ anything.
-   This helps your brain think about the problem so when you actually go over the material you have a better grasp of the context.

# Turn abstract concepts into social problems

-   Making abstract concepts into social problems or problems about our environment are easier for our Stone Age brains to solve!

# DON’T use timed tests early on

-   Don’t use timed tests whilst you’re still learning the material – this is only useful nearer exam time.
-   You want to familiarise yourself with the problems and get used to working them out properly, not put yourself in a stressful situation.  


The only time when passive rereading has sense is when some time has passed since the last time we tackle the material, but in this case, we are actually doing more of an exercise of [[Spaced Repetition]] **Active Recall combined with Spaced Repetition can really improve our information retention**
