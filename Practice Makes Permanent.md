# Practice & Active Recall

-   ‘Use it or lose it’ – if you don’t continuously use a skill or recall information, your brain will gradually discard it. Practice stops this happening.
-   Conceptual understanding is not enough on its own – you need to practise often to retain the memory and consolidate your understanding.
-   The more abstract a concept (e.g. maths) the more we have to practise applying it.

# Practice and Rote Memorisation

-   Western education tends to _over_\-emphasise the importance of conceptual understanding (those ‘Oh right, I get this’ moments); but memorisation, deliberate practice, is just as important to learning. Practice can help make the hard stuff easy.

# Active Recall

-   **Recall** is retrieval of information you’ve just learned.
-   If information is recalled enough times, it moves from short-term memory into long-term memory; this is why practice is so important, as it forces recall.
-   Even if you can’t successfully recall everything in your studies, this can still help you as you progress in your learning – it helps you practise recall, and also gives you a good idea of which concepts you’re struggling with and need to work on.
-   Studies indicate that students that employ active recall perform far better in exams and overall retention of information.
-   Examples of active recall include answering questions, drawing diagrams, paraphrasing.
