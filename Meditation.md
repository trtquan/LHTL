**Meditation is just a technique to bring about different modes of consciousness**

---

# Focused Attention Meditation

-   Enhance 'focused mode' thinking.
-   Involves concentrating on something specific; when your mind wanders, you bring it back to the object of focus.
-   Can help reduce feelings of depression/anxiety and build concentration.
-   Examples: Mantra, Chakra, visualisation, concentrating on sounds or breathing.

# Open Monitoring Meditation

-   Enhance 'diffuse mode' thinking.
-   Thoughts and feelings are allowed to flow freely, observed in a non-judgemental way, and allowed to pass without dwelling on or becoming attached to them.
-   Can enhance creativity.
-   Examples: Vipassana, mindfulness.
