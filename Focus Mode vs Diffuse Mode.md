A good learning practice is **switching between Focused and Diffuse modes in order to build strong neural structures**

>we assume that learning only happens while we’re cramming new ideas and concepts into our brains, when in fact, a lot happens during moments of mental quiet

> After some time in the Focused Mode, a nice idea is to let things settle back and put the Diffuse Mode to work

### Focused Thinking
-   When you are intently concentrated on something.
-   Conscious effort to engage or 'turn on'.
-   Mind is in a 'receiving' mode - information is pouring in.
-   Centred in prefrontal cortex.
-   Allows us to learn new things.

**_Advantages:_ ** absorbing and retaining new information  
**_Disadvantages:_** easier to fall into _[[Einstellung]]_

### Diffuse Thinking
-   When your thoughts wander around between different things - a catch-all term for any neural resting state (e.g. daydreaming, sleep)
-   Unconscious process - 'diffuse mode' can occur while you're daydreaming or not thinking about anything in particular.
-   Mind is in an 'organising' mode - information is being sorted into different parts of your brain as it makes sense of the new material.
-   Spread across different areas of the brain.
-   Helps us make intuitive leaps - connections between new ideas.

_Advantages:_ creativity, intuitive leaps, consolidates learning  
_Disadvantages:_ linked with anxiety and depression (if your mind is bouncing all over the place, it’s easier for it to be drawn into worry)
> you actually **relax without feelings of guilt or worry**.
### Switching between the two is needed for learning

-   You can only be in ONE mode at a time.
-   Switch back and forth between the two to progress your learning.
-   Focused concentration can help you memorise facts, but isn’t enough to help you understand a complex issue e.g. memorising parts of the heart doesn’t allow you to understand the heart’s functions. This is one reason why it’s important to switch between modes.
-   Consciously engage your 'focused mode' for set periods - concentrate on the material you're trying to learn.
-   Take regular breaks to allow your 'diffuse mode' to consolidate what you've learned - do some exercise, read a book, have a nap; anything that is fairly relaxing and _completely different_ from what you were focusing on.

> *Something similar to this happens also with our muscles. An ideal training plan implies working hard during training sessions (running, working out or whatever) followed by periods of relaxing and proper sleep, as is in this relaxation periods that the muscles really expand and develop, much like the creation of new neuronal connections on diffuse mode when learning.*
