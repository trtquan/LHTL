# What is Chunking?

![[Pasted image 20210218100425.png]]

‘Chunks’ are individual ideas or pieces of information bound together through meaning or use. The brain strings together different items into one concept.

For example, the concept ‘walk across the room’ is made up of several individual movements such as ‘stand’, ‘extend leg’, etc.

_Chunking can be thought of as:_

-   An origami model – each individual piece of information is a fold; when combined with other folds, a single model is formed. Folds can be combined in different ways to make different models; in the same way, different pieces of information can be combined to form different ‘chunks’
-   A jigsaw puzzle – each piece is a single idea; ideas can be slotted together to make up a cohesive picture (concept)

# Why is Chunking Useful?

-   Chunking allows the brain to free up working memory – as you can only hold four things in your working memory at one time. By combining several ideas into one concept, you can hold several complex thoughts (made up of dozens of individual ideas strung together) in your mind at once.
    
-   Chunking is an important part of learning: it’s why learning something like driving is very effortful at first (with lot of steps and things to remember) but becomes natural or automatic with practice.
    
-   Chunks can be related in surprising ways to other chunks (‘transfer’) – this can be useful when we’re trying to understand a topic or concept from a completely different field. This kind of ‘transfer’ generally happens when the brain is in diffuse mode.

# How to Form a Chunk

-   **Focused Attention** \- this is critical to form the ‘chunk’ in the first place. The brain is in ‘receiving mode’ when you are focusing, and this allows you to absorb the ideas that make up the chunk.
-   **Understanding** \- you MUST properly understand the ideas that make up the chunk. Understanding is the glue that sticks the different ideas together, so without this the ideas won’t stay in your memory.
-   **Practice** \- this is necessary to deeply ingrain the chunk into your long-term memory. Revisiting the idea helps it become familiar – you want to feel so comfortable with the key concepts you don’t even think about them, you can just do them. Practice can also give you context, so you know when to (or not) use the chunk.

All three steps are important – people often skimp on the practice, but this is what’s needed to retain the chunk after it’s formed. A common issue is understanding a concept in class and then not being able to apply it later; because the practice that would allow easy retrieval and use of that information has not been done.

As shown in the attached picture _"Chunking and Working Memory"_, **chunking allows us to avoid thinking about the underlying details of something**. Instead, we just retrieve the main chunk of information, which is "connected" with many other subchunks, allowing to store and process all by the means of the 4 working memory slots before they are moved to long-term memory later (hopefully!).

For example, when we are eating we do it pretty naturally as it's something that is already deeply chunked in our memory; we do not think _"Ok, I'll grab the fork. Now I'll grab some food with it. And now It's time to take it to my mouth. Now I should close my mouth and pull off the food from the fork. We are close to finishing! Now I just have to start chewing... 1 chew, 2 chews, 3 chews... Finally, I'll swallow the food. I'll repeat this until the dish is empty."_ In contrast, we just think _"Ok, I'll eat this piece, now this other, and so on until I'm done"_, without digging into the details of how to eat it as it's something natural.

> Finally, when we grasp a new chunk, this newly chunked information can be related in surprising ways with other chunks and altogether it may be useful to understand something else from a completely different field; this is something called **Transfer**. Also, as our **Library of Chunks** grows (more chunks are created into memory, i.e.: we gain expertise), we will be able to solve new problems or better solve old problems, as we will have a better big picture and we will be able to relate these chunks together to get a better solution. Moreover, through the **use of diffuse mode thinking, we may be able to easily connect different chunks and get easier to the right solution**, as illustrated in the attached picture _"Library of Neural Patterns and Diffuse Mode"_.
