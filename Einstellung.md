# What is Einstellung?


This concept refers to the fact that **when we already have a neural pattern established or developed for solving a certain problem, it's difficult to follow a different path** to find a new solution to the problem; this is the so-called _Einstellung Effect_ that fixes our mindset to follow a pre-established path. Moreover, we tend to use the already known neural path when facing a problem despite there may be other paths that lead to the actual solution or a better one, as illustrated in the attached picture _"Einstellung Neural Path"_. In other words, the Einstellung Effect is **the negative effect that our previous experiences may have when solving new problems.**

# We can counter Einstellung by:

-   Studying with others – discussing topics and problems with others can help us see different perspectives and solutions.
-   Taking a break and coming back to a problem – sometimes a fixed mindset can be overcome by allowing the brain to go into diffuse mode to make connections that were not immediately obvious.

**This test illustrates that we attempt to use the already known (old) tools to solve new problems, despite there may be other better tools and solutions in front of us.**
