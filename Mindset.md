# The Importance of Mindset

-   The thoughts you have about yourself and your capabilities have a huge impact on your ability to learn.
-   You don’t need to be hugely talented, very quick-thinking, or incredibly intelligent to learn – you can learn anything with practice and perseverance.

**Perseverance, “the virtue of the less brilliant”, can help you achieve**

# Turn Weaknesses into Strengths

-   **Slow learner:** use care, persistence, and flexibility to see the things that geniuses miss.
    
-   **Poor memory:** can help you see creative shortcuts that others can’t figure out.
    
-   **Natural contrariness:** use it to defy the preconceptions of others about what you can accomplish.
    
-   **Doubting yourself:** can keep you more open and flexible to seeing and doing what you need to do to succeed.
    
-   **Past experience ‘isn’t relevant’:** seemingly unconnected knowledge from your past can bring unexpected assets and new perspectives to your work or study.
