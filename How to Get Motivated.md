This is the full version of the 'How to Get Motivated' flowchart referenced in the 'Mindshift' MOOC (citation below).

-   It gives an in-depth process to work through to tackle the main causes of procrastination.
-   Very useful guide to help you put in place good habits and ask yourself the right questions to tackle bad ones.
-   The flowchart outlines techniques in more detail – some notes from the MOOC are below:

# Summary:

-   You’re less likely to procrastinate on tasks you actually like doing and that have a purpose – no one wants to do a pointless boring task.
-   The more you can do to make the task relevant to your life, and to make it fun, the less likely you are to procrastinate.
-   Three key ways to tackle procrastination: increase expectancy of success; increase value, and; decrease impulsiveness.
-   Try to be specific about what you’re avoiding; note when you’re procrastinating and why so you can use the best techniques to tackle it.

# Increase Expectancy of Success

-   **Plan ahead** \- sometimes we procrastinate because we’re avoiding feelings of uncertainty, or because we don’t know where to start. Having a ‘path’ to follow can be helpful in guiding us and keeping us on track.
-   **Set realistic goals** \- fear of failure is a common procrastination trigger so make goals realistic.
-   **Break tasks into small steps** \- focus on steps for set periods (e.g. 25 minutes) so you gradually and sustainably get things done.
-   **Keep a planner journal** \- track what works (or not) so you can improve, and log your thought habits (have you just told yourself you ‘don’t have the talent’ rather than you ‘can _develop_ the talent’?)
-   **Have a back-up plan** for when you fall off the wagon! (Life happens!)

---

# Increase Value

-   **Lots of rewards** \- if your brain thinks it will be rewarded, it will consider the task valuable. Wait until AFTER you finish the task before getting the reward!
-   **Savour the win/keep track of progress** \- a form of reward; this will help your brain learn that it’s a good thing to keep working steadily.
-   **Goal reminders** \- remind yourself of the value this task has to your long-term goals.
-   **Gamify** \- assigning points, competing with others, etc. is stuff your brain likes doing = value.

---

# Decrease Impulsiveness

-   **Reduce distractions** \- work in quiet, non-stimulating environments, turn off phones and push notifications, make it harder for yourself to access distractions (e.g. temporary website blockers).
-   **Routines and tasks** \- arrange work into a series of small challenges or tasks and write out your tasks for the day the night before – don’t let indecision about what to do next cause your mind to wander.
-   **Meditation** \- don’t try to suppress distracting thoughts, just note them and let them pass.

By working hard during focused times and doing the stuff you don’t want to do first thing, you can get to the point where you can actually relax during your downtime (without guilt or worrying) because you know you’re on track.
